flexnet-server-formula
======================

Formula (currently with variables set in state file and tested only on Debian) for installing the FlexNet licensing server (lmadmin). FlexNet is fetched from FEI's' Avizo site, but FlexNet server is not tied to Avizo in any way and can be used for any FlexNet dependent licensing.
